# Bistable_Gene_Expression

Stochastic simulation of a model for gene expression which may be bistable between two steady-state concentrations.
The results obtained from this code will be featured in a conference paper for FOSBE 2019 on the optimal experimental design for this stochastic model at thermal equilibrium.
