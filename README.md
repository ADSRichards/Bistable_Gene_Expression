# Bistable Gene Expression

Stochastic simulation of a model for gene expression which may be bistable between two steady-state concentrations.

The results obtained from this code are featured in a conference paper for FOSBE 2019 on the optimal experimental design for this stochastic model at thermal equilibrium.
